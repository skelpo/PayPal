/// The PayPal REST APIs use [webhooks](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/direct/webhooks) for event notification.
/// Webhooks are HTTP callbacks that receive notification messages for events. After you configure a webhook listener for your
/// app, you can [create a webhook](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/webhooks/v1/#webhooks_create), which subscribes
/// the webhook listener for your app to events. The `notifications` namespace contains resource collections for webhooks.
///
/// # Webhooks
///
/// Use the `/webhooks` resource to create, show details for, list all, update, and delete webhooks.
///
/// # Verify Webhook Signature
///
/// Use the `/verify-webhook-signature` resource to verify a webhook signature.
///
/// # Event Type
///
/// Use the `/webhooks-event-types` resource to list events to which webhooks can subscribe and the
/// `/webhooks/<webhook_id>/event-types` resource to list event subscriptions for a webhook.
///
/// # Simulate Event
///
/// Use the `/simulate-event` resource to use a sample payload to simulate a webhook event. The events that this call
/// generates only serve to validate the connection to the listener URL and to show how webhook events look.
///
/// - Note: You can also use the [Webhooks simulator](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/direct/webhooks/simulator/)
///   to simulate webhook events.
